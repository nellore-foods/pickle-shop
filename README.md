## This project has been moved/converted into the [NelFoo repositories on SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~dat-adi/nelfoo/).
While the project will be mirrored on GitHub for the general public, it is expected that active development will be taking place on SourceHut.

The stack of the project too has been changed in favor of building things from scratch and simplicity.
- nf-back: Golang + Gin backend.
- nf-front: SvelteKit + Skeleton UI/Tailwind CSS.
- miscellaneous: PostgresDB

Cheers.
